Pyra Inc. is a company that specializes in pyramid schemes. They are elusive, headquarters moving when anyone finds out where they are.
Cofounded by Daniel Willowson and Austin Willowson (formerly Austin Stockbridge) in 2003, they quickly grew fond of each other.
Now that they're together, they decided to help people with their pyramid schemes.
Eventually, an innovator named Alexander Simmons invented "Pyramidal Cards", which can be used to immediately start a pyramid scheme with minimal effort.
Then, they started selling their cards in "Pyra™ Packs", and started shipping to every store that they could find.
Only 1 store accepted their offer, which was a casino named "Balatro".
This is where the Pyramidal Cards, and Pyra™ Packs come from.
